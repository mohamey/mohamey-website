This is the magic that powers my website, it was coded in rails once upon a time but I changed it to PHP because I thought it'd be fun. I've since learned from my mistake and changed it to Nodejs.

Pretty easy to spin up, just clone the repo, run `npm install`, and `node main` for those of us using npm. `nodejs main.js` for the unfortunates who aren't. Works using Node 6.0.0 and above, never tried it with an earlier version ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
